describe a stack:
	last in first out
	pop: removes top of stack
	push: adds to top of stack
	peek: returns top of stack

describe a queue:
	first in first out
	enqueue: adds item to end of queue
	dequeue: removes item in front of queue
	peekFront: returns item in front of queue

describe diff between array and linked list implementations of stacks:
	array stack has limited size unless you dynamically allocate array, so it's more efficient.
	linked stack can add as many but it's less efficient.
